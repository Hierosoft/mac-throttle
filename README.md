Detect slowness issues due to throttling such as may be caused by an old battery. Provide steps that may improve the situation in some cases. See license for disclaimers.

## Examples
### Mid 2012 MacBook Air (A1466)
- Graphics: IntelHD 4000
- Processor: i5 1.8 GHz (model 1536M, no T2), but the script may inform you (using `pmset -g therm`) of the following issues:
  - CPU_Speed_Limit = 48 (100 is 100%)
  - CPU_Available_CPUs = 4 (4 is expected)
  - CPU_Speed_Limit = 31 (100 is 100%)
- You may have to compile CPUTune or other utilities using a different computer with the same version of macOS if the affected computer is too slow. On this computer, installing the version of Xcode that apple.com said was for my version of Catalina resulted in a ðŸš« over the Xcode app and the `git clone` command not working and saying "xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer), missing xcrun at: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/xcrun"
